# Hello! 👋 I'm Daniel

I'm a passionate aspiring novelist with a love for fantasy, an experienced music producer, and a curious physics enthusiast. I’m on a journey to build immersive, complex worlds for my stories, with the help of data science and simulation techniques. Currently, I’m studying data science and Python, and I’m working to expand my skills in data handling and simulation, which I believe are key to enhancing the depth and realism of my fictional worlds.

## 🌌 My Vision: Crafting Worlds Beyond Imagination

My goal is to develop simulations that add a layer of complexity to my fictional worlds, allowing them to grow and evolve in ways that are both surprising and consistent. I’m particularly interested in exploring how societies, lineages, and cultures could develop procedurally, so that my stories can unfold with a sense of organic depth. 

## 💼 Skills and Interests

- **Fantasy Worldbuilding**: I’m developing characters, lineages, and magic systems that form the backbone of my stories. Each step brings me closer to creating a world that feels real and immersive.
- **Music Production**: With years of experience, I enjoy creating soundscapes and experimenting with genres to complement my narratives and enrich the experience.
- **Physics Enthusiast**: I incorporate physics-inspired logic to bring a touch of realism to my fantasy worlds.
- **Data Science in Progress (Platzi)**: I’m currently building my foundation in Python and data analysis, learning the basics of modeling and visualization to support my worldbuilding projects.

## 📚 Current and Upcoming Projects

- **World Simulation in Python**: 
  - I’m working on creating a basic simulation of systems within my worlds, focusing on family lineages, economic dynamics, and social events.
  - Goal: to build foundational models that can grow and adapt, bringing complex narratives to life over time.

- **Procedural Name and Language Generator**: 
  - I’m developing a tool to create names and words with cultural roots that fit each society in my worlds, to add authenticity and immersion to the worldbuilding process.

## 🎯 Future Goals

1. Deepen my understanding of Python and data science to enhance my simulation skills.
2. Explore artificial intelligence techniques to add complexity to my world simulations.
3. Share tools and insights on GitHub that might be helpful to other writers and creators interested in worldbuilding.
