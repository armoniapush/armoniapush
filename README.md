# 👋 Hello! I'm Daniel

I'm a fantasy novelist, sound designer, and data science student with a deep interest in world simulation, artificial intelligence, and digital audio processing. I combine **storytelling, coding, and design** to craft immersive fictional universes, both narratively and sonically.

## 🌌 My Vision: Crafting Worlds Beyond Imagination

I believe that great stories are ecosystems—alive, evolving, and interconnected. My goal is to build **worlds that simulate themselves**, using procedural systems for cultures, mythologies, lineages, and economies. I approach fiction as a scientific experiment wrapped in emotion, intuition, and symbolic resonance.

## 💻 Current Project: VST Plugin Development in C++ (JUCE)

I'm currently working on my first **audio plugin (VST)** using the **JUCE framework in C++**.  
This project merges my background in music production with my growing expertise in C++ and audio DSP (Digital Signal Processing).  
The goal is to create a unique tool that reflects my creative philosophy—offering sound design that's emotional, experimental, and technically solid.

## 🎵 Creative-Technological Profile

| Area                | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| 🎧 **Music Production** | Over 10 years producing indie, ambient and experimental music. Currently focused on DSP design and plugin development. |
| 📚 **Fantasy Worldbuilding** | Creating characters, magic systems, and procedurally generated societies and mythologies. |
| 🧠 **AI & Simulation** | Exploring Python, C++ and machine learning to simulate societies, lineages, and dynamic world histories. |
| 🎨 **Design & UX** | Skilled in storytelling-driven interface design. You can check my work on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/danieldobles). |

## 🚧 Projects in Development

- **🎛 VST Audio Plugin (JUCE, C++)**
  - Digital audio effect aimed at enhancing creative workflows for producers and sound designers.
  - Focus on spectral manipulation, intuitive UI, and a vibe-based coding approach.
  
- **🌐 Procedural World Simulation (Python)**
  - Simulates genealogies, cultural shifts, and evolving societies.
  - Goal: to embed living systems inside fictional narratives.

- **🔤 Procedural Language Generator**
  - Tool for inventing languages and name systems that feel organically tied to each culture.

## 📈 Learning & Growth

Currently studying:
- **Data Science with Python (Platzi)**
- **C++ for Audio Programming**
- **AI applications for creative writing and simulation**

## 🎯 Future Goals

- Launch my first commercial audio plugin.
