# Hello! 👋 I'm Daniel

I'm a passionate fantasy novelist, experienced music producer, and physics enthusiast. My mission is to combine art and science to bring complex and detailed worlds to life within my stories. I'm currently delving into data science to enhance my skills in handling and analyzing large amounts of information, which is essential for the simulation and world-generation projects I aim to build.

## 🌌 My Vision: Creating Worlds Beyond Imagination

My goal is to develop interactive simulations for my fictional worlds, creating realities with depth and coherence beyond what could be achieved manually. I aspire to build simulated environments where events, geography, and societies evolve procedurally and autonomously, allowing me to explore my stories in an entirely new dimension.

## 💼 Experience and Skills

- **Fantasy Novel Writing**: Developing characters, lineages, and magic systems is the core of my stories, which I continuously explore and refine.
- **Music Production**: With years of experience, I’ve experimented with genres and techniques that enrich the narrative of my projects.
- **Physics and Simulation**: My interest in physics helps me construct worlds with logical foundations and implement natural systems realistically.
- **Data Science (Platzi)**: I specialize in Python, data analysis, and mathematical modeling, working on projects involving data visualization and procedural algorithms.

## 📚 Featured Projects

- **Procedural World Simulator in Unity**: 
  - A tool in development to simulate kingdoms, lineages, and historical events in my stories.
  - Features: autonomous character and lineage generation, detailed timelines, and evolving economic systems.

- **Complex Simulations in Python**: 
  - A current project focused on creating deep simulations of the systems in my worlds, from family dynamics to economic trends and social events.
  - Goal: to build models that grow and change over time, generating rich, detailed narratives.

- **Complex Name and Language Generator**: 
  - A tool that creates names and words with linguistic roots tailored to each culture, enhancing the authenticity of worldbuilding.

## 🎯 Next Steps and Development Goals

1. Complete the development of autonomous simulations using Python.
2. Dive deeper into artificial intelligence to enrich my simulations.
3. Share worldbuilding tools on GitHub that can be valuable for other creators and writers.
